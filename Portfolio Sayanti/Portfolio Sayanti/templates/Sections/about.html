                Hello! I’m <strong>Sayanti Roy</strong>, a passionate and curious learner from Brainware University, pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science (AI & ML). I thrive on solving real-world problems and building smart solutions that make life better.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy working across the stack and have a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and C, along with hands-on web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m deeply interested in AI/ML and cloud technologies like AWS, and I've contributed to projects such as intelligent traffic control systems using HIGIT maps.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also known for being a self-starter — I love exploring new tools and techniques through self-study and practical implementation. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me sketching, listening to music, or exploring ways to make tech more human.
            </p>
